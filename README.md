=========

Working set of raw RDF data in [Turtle](http://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/turtle/) format for all standard data lists and schema (mostly CIDOC-CRM extensions) used at STARC.

These require no further processing, as they are already in RDF format. Just compile to triples/quads using a RDF parser (e.g. rapper - http://librdf.org/raptor/) and import into the triple store.
